        not register it on any :class:`flask.Flask` application.

        The endpoints for the API for ``model`` will be available at
        ``<url_prefix>/<collection_name>``. If `collection_name` is ``None``,
        the lowercase name of the provided model class will be used instead, as
        accessed by ``model.__tablename__``. (If any black magic was performed
        on ``model.__tablename__``, this will be reflected in the endpoint
        URL.) For more information, see :ref:`collectionname`.

        This function must be called at most once for each model for which you
        wish to create a ReSTful API. Its behavior (for now) is undefined if
        called more than once.

        This function returns the :class:`flask.Blueprint` object which handles
        the endpoints for the model. The returned :class:`~flask.Blueprint` has
        already been registered with the :class:`~flask.Flask` application
        object specified in the constructor of this class, so you do *not* need
        to register it yourself.

        `model` is the SQLAlchemy model class for which a ReSTful interface
        will be created. Note this must be a class, not an instance of a class.

        `app` is the :class:`Flask` object on which we expect the blueprint
        created in this method to be eventually registered. If not specified,
        the Flask application specified in the constructor of this class is
        used.

        `methods` specify the HTTP methods which will be made available on the
        ReSTful API for the specified model, subject to the following caveats:

        * If :http:method:`get` is in this list, the API will allow getting a
          single instance of the model, getting all instances of the model, and
          searching the model using search parameters.
        * If :http:method:`patch` is in this list, the API will allow updating
          a single instance of the model, updating all instances of the model,
          and updating a subset of all instances of the model specified using
          search parameters.
        * If :http:method:`delete` is in this list, the API will allow deletion
          of a single instance of the model per request.
        * If :http:method:`post` is in this list, the API will allow posting a
          new instance of the model per request.

        The default set of methods provides a read-only interface (that is,
        only :http:method:`get` requests are allowed).

        `collection_name` is the name of the collection specified by the given
        model class to be used in the URL for the ReSTful API created. If this
        is not specified, the lowercase name of the model will be used.

        `url_prefix` the URL prefix at which this API will be accessible.

        If `allow_patch_many` is ``True``, then requests to
        :http:patch:`/api/<collection_name>?q=<searchjson>` will attempt to
        patch the attributes on each of the instances of the model which match
        the specified search query. This is ``False`` by default. For
        information on the search query parameter ``q``, see
        :ref:`searchformat`.

        If `allow_delete_many` is ``True``, then requests to
        :http:delete:`/api/<collection_name>?q=<searchjson>` will attempt to
        delete each instance of the model that matches the specified search
        query. This is ``False`` by default. For information on the search
        query parameter ``q``, see :ref:`searchformat`.

        `validation_exceptions` is the tuple of possible exceptions raised by
        validation of your database models. If this is specified, validation
        errors will be captured and forwarded to the client in JSON format. For
        more information on how to use validation, see :ref:`validation`.

        If `allow_functions` is ``True``, then requests to
        :http:get:`/api/eval/<collection_name>` will return the result of
        evaluating SQL functions specified in the body of the request. For
        information on the request format, see :ref:`functionevaluation`. This
        if ``False`` by default. Warning: you must not create an API for a
        model whose name is ``'eval'`` if you set this argument to ``True``.

        If either `include_columns` or `exclude_columns` is not ``None``,
        exactly one of them must be specified. If both are not ``None``, then
        this function will raise a :exc:`IllegalArgumentError`.
        `exclude_columns` must be an iterable of strings specifying the columns
        of `model` which will *not* be present in the JSON representation of
        the model provided in response to :http:method:`get` requests.
        Similarly, `include_columns` specifies the *only* columns which will be
        present in the returned dictionary. In other words, `exclude_columns`
        is a blacklist and `include_columns` is a whitelist; you can only use
        one of them per API endpoint. If either `include_columns` or
        `exclude_columns` contains a string which does not name a column in
        `model`, it will be ignored.

        If you attempt to either exclude a primary key field or not include a
        primary key field for :http:method:`post` requests, this method will
        raise an :exc:`IllegalArgumentError`.

        If `include_columns` is an iterable of length zero (like the empty
        tuple or the empty list), then the returned dictionary will be
        empty. If `include_columns` is ``None``, then the returned dictionary
        will include all columns not excluded by `exclude_columns`.

        If `include_methods` is an iterable of strings, the methods with names
        corresponding to those in this list will be called and their output
        included in the response.

        See :ref:`includes` for information on specifying included or excluded
        columns on fields of related models.

        `results_per_page` is a positive integer which represents the default
        number of results which are returned per page. Requests made by clients
        may override this default by specifying ``results_per_page`` as a query
        argument. `max_results_per_page` is a positive integer which represents
        the maximum number of results which are returned per page. This is a
        "hard" upper bound in the sense that even if a client specifies that
        greater than `max_results_per_page` should be returned, only
        `max_results_per_page` results will be returned. For more information,
        see :ref:`serverpagination`.

        .. deprecated:: 0.9.2
           The `post_form_preprocessor` keyword argument is deprecated in
           version 0.9.2. It will be removed in version 1.0. Replace code that
           looks like this::

               manager.create_api(Person, post_form_preprocessor=foo)

           with code that looks like this::

               manager.create_api(Person, preprocessors=dict(POST=[foo]))

           See :ref:`processors` for more information and examples.

        `post_form_preprocessor` is a callback function which takes
        POST input parameters loaded from JSON and enhances them with other
        key/value pairs. The example use of this is when your ``model``
        requires to store user identity and for security reasons the identity
        is not read from the post parameters (where malicious user can tamper
        with them) but from the session.

        `preprocessors` is a dictionary mapping strings to lists of
        functions. Each key is the name of an HTTP method (for example,
        ``'GET'`` or ``'POST'``). Each value is a list of functions, each of
        which will be called before any other code is executed when this API
        receives the corresponding HTTP request. The functions will be called
        in the order given here. The `postprocessors` keyword argument is
        essentially the same, except the given functions are called after all
        other code. For more information on preprocessors and postprocessors,
        see :ref:`processors`.

        `primary_key` is a string specifying the name of the column of `model`
        to use as the primary key for the purposes of creating URLs. If the
        `model` has exactly one primary key, there is no need to provide a
        value for this. If `model` has two or more primary keys, you must
        specify which one to use.

        `serializer` and `deserializer` are custom serialization functions. The
        former function must take a single argument representing the instance
        of the model to serialize, and must return a dictionary representation
        of that instance. The latter function must take a single argument
        representing the dictionary representation of an instance of the model
        and must return an instance of `model` that has those attributes. For
        more information, see :ref:`serialization`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17.0
           Added the `serializer` and `deserializer` keyword arguments.

        .. versionadded:: 0.16.0
           Added the `app` and `allow_delete_many` keyword arguments.

        .. versionadded:: 0.13.0
           Added the `primary_key` keyword argument.

        .. versionadded:: 0.10.2

        .. versionchanged:: 0.10.0
           Removed `authentication_required_for` and `authentication_function`
           keyword arguments.

           Use the `preprocesors` and `postprocessors` keyword arguments
           instead. For more information, see :ref:`authentication`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9.2
           Added the `preprocessors` and `postprocessors` keyword arguments.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9.0
           Added the `max_results_per_page` keyword argument.

        .. versionadded:: 0.7
           Added the `exclude_columns` keyword argument.

        .. versionadded:: 0.6
           This functionality was formerly in :meth:`create_api`, but the
           blueprint creation and registration have now been separated.

        .. versionadded:: 0.6
           Added the `results_per_page` keyword argument.

        .. versionadded:: 0.5
           Added the `include_columns` and `validation_exceptions` keyword
           argument.

        .. versionadded:: 0.4
           Added the `allow_functions`, `allow_patch_many`,
           `authentication_required_for`, `authentication_function`, and
           `collection_name` keyword arguments.

        .. versionadded:: 0.4
           Force the model name in the URL to lowercase.
